## Check within you pipeline

You can make your pipeline fail if a project does not have the correct licenses.
To do so create a `pyproject.toml` and add underneath `tool.license_scanner` two lists `allowed-licenses` and `allowed-packages`.
If a package does not have license in `allowed-licenses` AND it is not in `allowed-packages` it will throw an error.

```toml
[tool.license_scanner]
allowed-licenses = [
  "MIT",
  "apache software license",
  "apache software license v2",
  "apache software license v3",
  "BSD license",
  "BSD 3-clause license",
  'GNU lesser general public license',
  'GNU lesser general public license v2',
  'GNU lesser general public license v3',
  'Python software foundation license',
  'Mozilla public license 2.0 (mpl 2.0)',
  'mozilla',
]
allowed-packages = ["license_scanner"]
```

To run the license scanner make sure you are in the same directory as `pyproject.toml` and run `license_scanner -m whitelist` or `python -m license_scanner -m whitelist`. 
It will now throw you an error if your environment has an package with a license you did not approve of.

### Example: Github actions

This github actions triggers every time you make a PR to the main branch. With `pip install .` it installs the current project, next it installs `license_scanner`, and lastly it runs the check.

Be aware, if you want to do unittest make sure you install `pytest` AFTER you run license_scanner. Otherwise `pytest` is in your environment when you check for unwanted licenses.

```yaml
name: Licenses check

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  deploy:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'
    - name: Check for licenses
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install .
        pip install license_scanner
        python -m license_scanner -m whitelist

```
